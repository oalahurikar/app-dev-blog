Database migration involves moving data, schemas, and objects from one database to another or upgrading an existing database. This can be between different systems (like MySQL to PostgreSQL) or from local servers to the cloud. But why do businesses need database migration?

### Why Is Database Migration Important?

1. **Modernization**: Upgrading to more advanced technology to gain better performance and features.

2. **Cloud Adoption**: Moving from on-premises to cloud databases for greater scalability and cost-effectiveness.

3. **Scalability**: Supporting increased data volume and improving performance with a more scalable database solution.

4. **Cost Savings**: Migrating to cheaper cloud or open-source databases can lower infrastructure costs.

5. **Consolidation**: Reducing redundancy by combining multiple databases for easier management.

6. **Security and Compliance**: Moving to a more secure platform to adhere to modern security standards.

7. **Data Integration**: Unifying data sources to improve data quality, analytics, and business insights.

8. **System Updates**: Adapting to changes in business applications or platforms, which might require new database capabilities.

9. **End of Life**: Migrating from outdated systems that are no longer supported by vendors.

### Key Steps in Database Migration
